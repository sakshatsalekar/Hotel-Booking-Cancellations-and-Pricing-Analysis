# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing hotel booking data to understand the factors affecting hotel reservation cancellations, pricing trends, and customer booking preferences. The analysis provides actionable insights to help hotels optimize their booking strategies and minimize cancellations.

## Research Questions
1. What factors contribute to hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can hotels reduce the rate of cancellations?
3. What insights can be gained to assist hotels in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Key Insights
- **Cancellations and Pricing**: Higher prices are directly correlated with an increase in cancellations. Offering competitive pricing, especially during peak seasons, may reduce the cancellation rate.
- **Resort vs City Hotels**: City hotels attract more bookings compared to resort hotels, which tend to have higher rates.

- **Booking Channels**: 46% of reservations come through online travel agencies, while only 4% are made directly by visiting the hotel.

## Recommendations
- **Pricing Strategy**: To prevent cancellations, hotels could explore dynamic pricing models and offer discounts based on location or specific periods.
- **Campaigns for January**: Hotels should implement targeted marketing campaigns to increase revenue during months with high cancellations, like January.
- **Service Improvements**: For countries with high cancellations, such as Portugal, enhancing hotel services and customer experience could reduce cancellation rates.
